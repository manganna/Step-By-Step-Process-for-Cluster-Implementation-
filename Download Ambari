cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
wget http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/ambari/centos6/2.x/updates/2.2.1.0/ambari.repo

// check the version of the ambari that you are downloading. in future while launching the wizard, choose your HDP Repo keeping in mind 
as to which version is compatible with your Ambari Version

Also , in the install wizard , you can change the link related to your repo file to indicate another version of Ambari . For e.g. (as it 
stands now) , the latest version of HDP 2.2 is 2.2.8 , but if I want 2.2.6 , I can change that link and instead of 2.2.8 , substitute 
it with 2.2.6 and the installation will go through.
