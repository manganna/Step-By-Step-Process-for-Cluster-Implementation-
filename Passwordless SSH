// In the master node 

#STEP 1
#Create public and private keys using ssh-key-gen on local-host


ssh-keygen

// This command Generating public/private rsa key pair.
// Generating public/private rsa key pair.


Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa):[Enter key]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press enter key]
Enter same passphrase again: [Pess enter key]
Your identification has been saved in /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
33:b3:fe:af:95:95:18:11:31:d5:de:96:2f:f2:35:f9 // this is the private key and you should copy this key to remote host so that you can 
the remote host from the master node

#STEP 2
#Copy the public key to remote-host using ssh-copy-id

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote-host

// then it will ask the passowrd for the remote host if you provide the password for the remote host then you will be able to
communitate with the other node.
